# 🤖 GrokBot – A Terminal-Based AI Chatbot in Python

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**GrokBot** is a rule-based chatbot built using Python that runs entirely in the terminal. It responds intelligently to user inputs such as greetings, time/date queries, questions about Python, mock weather inquiries, and more — offering a simple yet effective conversational experience.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To demonstrate a functional, lightweight chatbot using pure Python — ideal for learning basic NLP techniques, regex-based intent detection, and terminal interactivity without relying on AI APIs.

---

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Regex-based pattern recognition  
- ✅ Friendly responses to greetings and farewells  
- ✅ Date and time replies using Python’s `datetime`  
- ✅ Fun mock weather responses for any city  
- ✅ Answers general Python-related questions  
- ✅ Fallback responses for unrecognized input  
- ✅ Clean exit and error handling  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.6+**
- `re` — for regex-based intent matching  
- `random` — for varied responses  
- `datetime` — for current date/time  
- `sys` — for version checking and clean exits
